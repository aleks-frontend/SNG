        <h2 class="heading u-color-yellow u-mt2">ABOUT STUMP GRINDING</h2>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Why Stump Grind?</h3>
        <p>After having a tree removed, sometimes it is not necessary to remove the stump, as it can sit in the garden and slowly rot away. However, some stumps can cause issues:</p>
        <ul class="regList regList--customBullet">
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">Termites - Pest inspectors often recommend removing stumps around houses, as they can be a breeding ground for termites.</li>
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">Mowing - stumps in the lawn can be a pain, either it takes time to mow or whipersnip around them, or they disappear into the lawn and you hit them with the lawn mower, causing expensive damage to the lawn mower.</li>
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">Reshooting - Some trees are very prolific. It can be difficult to stop them reshooting without removing the stump itself.</li>
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">Trip hazards - It’s easy to stumble over a low stump especially hidden in grass</li>
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">Keep the place tidy - Getting rid of a tree stump leaves the lawn feeling larger, more spacious and useable.</li>
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">Making way for extensions - Many of my clients want a tree stump removed, in order to build a pergola, deck or just to extend the lawn.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subHeading u-mt3">How much does stump grinding cost?</h3>
        <p>I provide a fixed price quote, before the job is done so there are no surprises. There’s also no obligation to go ahead, after receiving the quote.</p>
        <p>Factors that determine the cost are:</p>
        <ul class="regList regList--customBullet">
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">The size and height of the stump; location/ease of access; if the stump is rotted versus freshly cut; whether roots are running through the lawn that need removal; and if there is rock, concrete or earth mounded around the stump.</li>
          <li class="regList__item u-mb1">For stumps below about 50cm the cost can be as little as $120. Additional small stumps added to the job, can be as little as $20.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subHeading u-mt3">Renting a stump grinder, vs hiring Stump n Grind</h3>
        <p>Renting a small stump grinder from a hire shop, will cost at least $140.00 for a half day.</p>
        <p>These machines can do a fine job, but can also be very slow. Stump grinders for hire are usually smaller and less powerful than those used by a professional stump grindingbusiness, meaning they vibrate, and require some physical effort. You are usually required to arrange to pick-up and drop-off the machine, and will need to clean up the wood chips after the stump is removed.</p>
        <p>Using Stump n Grind can cost less than the cost of hiring, especially for smaller jobs. The dirty and dusty job will be done to your satisfaction with the site tidied up properly, with no effort to the client.</p>
        <p>If you decide to hire a stump grinder and do the job yourself, feel free to give me a call for any advice. Be sure to have the proper safety equipment of face shield and earmuffs and safety screens where necessary: older stump grinders can sometimes spit rocks back at the operator, or impact on nearby buildings.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading u-mt3">Why not dig up a tree stump?</h3>
        <p>Digging up a small stump by hand is an option, but even the smallest stump can take a large amount of digging, and an enormous hole. Several hours of hard work for a stump of only 20 or 30cm in diameter is not unusual when digging up a stump.</p>
        <p>For larger stumps, an excavator or backhoe can work, however in most cases these machines will cause a lot of lawn damage. Roots can be entangled in foundations and under ground services, and cause serious damage to these when removing.</p>
        <p>After the stump is removed, you will then need to dispose of it. Tip fees can cost over $100 / tonne for root balls. Additionally, more soil will be needed to fill the hole, to bring the site level again.</p>
        <p>Where there are major earth works happening, such as retaining walls, house foundations or swimming pools, digging up stumps can be the best option, as you will have heavy machinery there digging up the area anyway.</p>

        <h2 class="heading u-color-yellow u-mt0">THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN INQUIRING ABOUT STUMP REMOVAL</h2>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Ask about insurance</h3>
        <p>Stump grinders are powerful machines capable of damaging water or power lines, and throwing rocks a long way. Stump grinding is dangerous work, and not having proper insurance is simply unacceptable.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Let the operator know what the goal is with the area</h3>
        <p>Getting the area back to lawn, Putting in a driveway, Building, putting in a fence. These can all affect how to approach the job.</p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Under ground services</h3>
        <p>Make sure you let the operator know if there are under ground services. In most cases power and sewage is over 600mm below ground level and won’t be an issue. If earth works have happened after services have been installed this can change. Storm water pipes, garden lights and water lines can sometimes be only just under the surface. If under ground services have been discussed and the operator stays with a safe distance from them we take no responsibility for damage to those services.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">How deep do you go</h3>
        <p>
          Usually we remove the stump to about 10 or 15cm below ground level, this gives enough room for soil and grass to grow over the top. In a lot of cases the stump wont be much deeper than that. In some cases rocks or other objects can make it difficult to achieve this. The area around the stump needs to be taken into consideration as well. Will they grind the roots around the stump? That is a question you will have to ask. We will grind any surface roots in the immediate area around the stump and major roots that belong to the stump farther from the area. Grinding roots farther from the stump is done assuming it’s insured they don’t belong to any other trees. If that is the case caution should be used as grinding a large root of a living tree can cause harm. Be sure to ask about depth as some operators simply skim the stump below grade so it is no longer seen, over time the stump can reappear. Unless that is the request by the customer, this type of work is unacceptable.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeading">Clean up</h3>
        <p>
          Check what state the place will be left in after the job is completed. Many grinders doesn’t include clean up. This means they grind the stump, send chips flying everywhere and leave you with a spread out mess to tackle. I will normally leave the area raked flat ready for the grass to grow through, or leave the wood chips pushed into a pile ready for you to use in the garden. On larger stumps, over 1m, the chip piles that result can be overwhelming for the average home owner. It is worth thinking about or discussing what is to be done with the chips.
        </p>
        <p class="u-mt3"><strong>We also have a network of tree service professionals and landscapers so all of your garden needs can be met. Just ask, and I can recommend others to complete your out door projects.</strong></p>
